1. why is it still trying to sync products which aren't in the selected categories for the picked website?
2. when the cron is made to run every 15 mins it check only once per 15 mins. Can we make it once per 5 mins?
3. pending products are all the products not the ones for this website only - Products Pending:	15108 products
4. what will happen when all the products are synced and there are no more products to sync? Will it stop trying to sync or will it start over again?
